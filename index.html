                Hey, you! My dearest chaos-companion! Happy birthday, my favorite idiot! ðŸŽ‰</p>

               <p> Another year down (WOOHOO!!!), and with it, another round of lifeâ€™s unpredictable plot twists. And you? Youâ€™ve handled it all like the legend you are. Sure, sometimes it feels like weâ€™re stuck in the worldâ€™s most chaotic group project, but heyâ€”youâ€™re still here, standing strong (even if itâ€™s occasionally on wobbly legs). Thatâ€™s a win in my book!
                
                Life throws its storms, but donâ€™t you ever forgetâ€”Iâ€™m your forever umbrella. Whether you need someone to scream, laugh, cry, or even if u have some world domination plans, im ur gurl! Iâ€™m always just a call, text, or dramatic signal away.</p>
                
               <p> Iâ€™ll always be here for you, idiot. To cheer you on, pick you up off the floor, or share a slice of cake in solidarityâ€”itâ€™s your call. The world is brighter, better, and infinitely more fun because youâ€™re in it.
                
                Youâ€™ve got so much strength and light inside you, even on the days when you donâ€™t feel it. And in case you ever need remindingâ€”youâ€™re never alone in this wild ride. Iâ€™ve got your back. Always.
                
              
               <p>With LOTS of Love, Mister Nayana G&#x1F60E;</p>
